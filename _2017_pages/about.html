      <p>Functional Scala 2019 (London Edition) is a by-community, for-community, independent conference that exists to serve the needs of the Scala community.</p>

      <p>With no commercial interests, and focused only on Scala (not other languages or communities), Functional Scala 2019 hopes to bring together some of the most passionate software developers working in the Scala programming language for two days of fun-filled talks, workshops, and panels.</p>

      <p>Thanks to sponsors, the event is free of charge (although donations are suggested).</p>
