  topic: Fancy (Z)Streams for Fancy Programs
  description: "Streams are a declarative, high-level abstraction for representing
many types of programs. In particular, purely functional streams built
on top of effect monads are a joy to use for constructing performant,
resource safe and concurrent applications. Many patterns written
using manual concurrency management can be elegantly represented using
streams, resulting in concise and correct programs.

ZIO's streams library was introduced at the end of 2018. Since then,
it has gone through several iterations, improving compositionality,
resource saftey and support for concurrency. In this talk, we will
show how, by using the ZStream and ZSink data types, we can quickly
construct concurrent and resource-safe applications. We will also look
at the internal representation of ZStream to gain a deeper
understanding of how it works under the hood. No prior experience with
the library is required!"

  topic: Designing a Functional GraphQL Library
  description: "GraphQL is becoming a strong alternative to REST for exposing APIs. In
this talk, I will introduce Caliban, a new functional library for
writing GraphQL backends in Scala. I will go through the process of
creating the library from scratch and explain my design choices: how
to minimize boilerplate, how to expose a pure API with explicit
errors, how to handle subscriptions, etc."

  topic: Ray Tracing with ZIO
  description: "In the FP realm in Scala, Tagless Final is a popular technique to have injectable, testable, extensible components. An alternative technique is the usage of environmental effects, that provides similar benefits, with a lower entry barrier and improved type-inference.
During this talk we will build a fully testable ray tracer in Scala with ZIO using this environmental effects. We will also explore some useful combinators available in ZIO to build concurrent, resource-safe applications."

  topic: Composition using Arrows and Monoidal Categories
  description: "Monads and monad-like types are the perfect fit for many eDSLs in functional programming, however, sometimes we need to enforce stricter language requirements such as static process analysis, minimizing allocations, purity, totality and linear-like semantics (exactly-one use). In such cases, Arrows and Symmetric Monoidal Categories (SMC) may be a fine choice, still they are generally avoided because manual composing is hard. We present WIP macro library volga that is for arrows and SMC what is for-comprehension for monads. We will discuss use cases applicability of Arrows and SMC, as well as syntax and semantics of volga."

  topic: Scala/Kotlin interop
  description: "Scala is a language that many companies use nowadays. But it’s also considered to be very complex and hard to master. So, some of those companies are looking to migrate to Kotlin. Do they need to write everything from scratch, though?
In this talk, we’ll see how we can build Kotlin services on top of Scala infrastructure, so you can have best of both."

  topic: Validity-based testing
  description: "Writing correct software is difficult. Property testing has the
potential to make safe software easier and cheaper. However, current
methods still involve the costly requirement for programmers to write
generators, shrinking functions and properties. Validity-based testing
promises free generators, free shrinking and cheap properties, to allow
property-based testing to fulfill its true potential."
